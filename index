   “Learning good qualities is good, but learning patience, respect, and compassion is better.” - Sujatha Nelluri. Just learning good qualities such as selflessness might seem good enough, but compassion, patience, and respect are better characteristics to learn. Displaying those qualities so other people learn them benefits society. Having compassion, respect, and patience helps people develop and strengthen their social relations. My generation has displayed respect, compassion, and patience and has developed social relationships by observing and learning from other generations.

     To begin, my and other generations have observed other generations, learned from them, and developed patience and respect. In my interview with Coach Sprott, I found out he learned “to be respectful” and “to be patient” from his parents. He also learned from his colleagues. They told him “to be patient with students” and stay calm no matter how much the students annoyed him. He displayed patience and respect when he was interviewed. Whenever he was asked to repeat his sentences multiple times, he never got frustrated. He always remained calm and spoke in a respectful manner, no matter the age of the people he spoke to. My generation has followed his and other people’s examples and has started becoming more patient and respectful than before. They have displayed those traits and have expanded the number of social relations ever since. 

     Secondly, people from different generations have demonstrated compassion and my generation has learned from them. In On the Road - A Tough Teacher’s Alter Ego, the teacher appears strict on the outside but is compassionate on the inside. He is compassionate because he is a top blood donor at a hospital. “Whenever Mr. O’Connor isn’t torturing kids with calculus he’s on a whole nother tangent cuddling sick babies” for “three days a week for the past 20 years.” His students were shocked when they learned their teacher had an alter ego, and then they started respecting the teacher more than ever. Some of the people I know in my generation have improved their knowledge of compassion by taking Mr. O’Connor as an example, and have begun being compassionate to people. This has led to more social bonding in Gen-Z.
